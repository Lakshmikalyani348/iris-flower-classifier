# Iris Flower Classifier using Random Forest

This is a simple machine learning project built using Python and Scikit-learn. The model is trained on the popular Iris flower dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: *Setosa, **Versicolor, and **Virginica* based on their physical measurements.

## Features

- Uses the Random Forest algorithm for classification
- Shows model accuracy
- Warns users if their input is outside typical feature ranges
- Predicts flower species based on user input
- Easy-to-read code with Telugu inline comments

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is loaded using Scikit-learnâ€™s built-in load_iris() function.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages (if not already installed):

bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn

## Run the script
python iris flower classification.py

## Output Example
Predicted Iris flower class is: Iris-setosa
Classifier used: RandomForestClassifier
Prediction confidence: 95.67%
